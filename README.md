Dagger 2 Example Application
============================

An example modular application built with Dagger 2 for the purpose of my blog post. It shows some
useful design patterns.

Building and running
--------------------

You need Java 8 and Gradle in order to run this example. When you load the project into the IDE
for the first time, it will complain about a missing class in `app-sample` subproject. This is
intended, because Dagger 2 is about code generation. You must build the project in order to
generate the missing class.
